Need at least one argument (SANE device address)!
usage: scan2pdf.sh SANEADDRESS [odd|even] [reversed]

       If "odd" or "even" is given, this script assumes it will scan odd or even
       pages; odd pages are saved as xyz-odd.pdf, even pages are merged with
       previously scanned odd pages.

       If "reversed" is given, this script assumes the scanned pages to be in
       reversed order (paper stack scanned back to front); this argument is
       only processd when both even and odd pages were scanned (prior to
       merging both) and can be used to simplify double-sided scanning (just
       flip stack and scan again).
