Recently I bought a Brother multifunction printer and was impressed by the Linux
support Brother apparently is providing. The device just worked. In addition,
Brother offers a small tool brscan-skey which makes it possible to initiate
scans via the printer's scan key.

I created this program because...
 ...brscan-skey is just a binary and I didn't want to install it on my server;
 ...the tool intrigued me -- how does it work?

brotherscankeyd is distributed in the hope that it will be of help. It comes
with absolutely no warranty (see license info above).

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program offers a network service to execute scripts/programs if a scan key
event occurs. It registers scan-to entries on one or more network printers and
listens to UDP packets coming from these devices. If a known scan key action is
registered, the corresponding script is called.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which programs and libraries are needed?
(In parantheses: Gentoo Linux versions this program was created/tested with)

Python3  (3.4.3-r1)
pysnmp   (4.2.5)
linuxfd  (1.3, cf. https://www.github.com/abelbeck/linuxfd)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Place the files in the following directories:

   /usr/local/bin/brotherscankeyd.py
   /usr/local/etc/brotherscankeyd.ini
   /usr/local/share/brotherscankeyd/scan2image.sh
   /usr/local/share/brotherscankeyd/scan2pdf.sh

Then you should edit brotherscankeyd.ini to reflect your system's configuration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The service is started by calling brotherscankeyd.py with the start or daemonise
command. The latter will detach the program from the controlling terminal, thus
daemonising it.

Calling brotherscankeyd.py stop will stop the daemon. To control this behaviour,
the PID file /var/run/brotherscankeyd.pid is created. If this is not possible,
perhaps due to denied permission, the PID is placed in /tmp/brotherscankeyd.pid.

For further information, please consult the program's internal help system.

Changelog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2016-07-05: initial release as "works for me" version (except for the scan
            scripts scan2image.sh and scan2pdf.sh; they are still untested)

2016-07-10: switched to a unified output system (Python module logging and
            custom ConsoleHandler for coloured output);
            moved CONFIGFILE and PIDFILE to standard locations /etc and
            /var/run respectively (program tries both paths);
            scan2* scripts revisited, now seem to work; various bug fixes

2016-07-17: debugged program after first server trials; removed SEVERE scan
            script quoting errors, altered script calling procedure,
            introduced OpenRC init script

2016-07-25: moved SNMP requests into subprocess to avoid blocking the main loop

2016-08-06: fixed a script calling race condition (scanner not immediately ready
            for connects of scanimage/scanadt after issuing a notification) by
            introducing a two second delay
