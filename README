Recently I bought a Brother multifunction printer and was impressed by the Linux
support Brother apparently is providing. The device just worked. In addition,
Brother offers a small tool brscan-skey which makes it possible to initiate
scans via the printer's scan key.

I created this program because...
 ...brscan-skey is just a binary and I didn't want to install it on my server;
 ...the tool intrigued me -- how does it work?

brotherscankeyd is distributed in the hope that it will be of help. It comes
with absolutely no warranty (see license info above).

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program offers a network service to execute scripts/programs if a scan key
event occurs. It registers scan-to entries on one or more network printers and
listens to UDP packets coming from the devices. If a known scan key action is
registered, the corresponding script is called.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which programs and libraries are needed?
(In parantheses: Gentoo Linux versions this program was created/tested with)

Python3  (3.4.3-r1)
pysnmp   (4.2.5)
linuxfd  (1.0, cf. https://www.github.com/abelbeck/linuxfd)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Place the files in the following directories:

   /usr/local/bin/brotherscankeyd.py
   /usr/local/etc/brotherscankeyd.ini
   /usr/local/share/brotherscankeyd/scan2image.sh
   /usr/local/share/brotherscankeyd/scan2pdf.sh

Then you should edit brotherscankeyd.ini to reflect your system's configuration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The service is started by calling brotherscankeyd.py with the start or daemonise
command. The latter will detach the program from the controlling terminal, thus
daemonising it.

Calling brotherscankeyd.py stop will stop the daemon. To control this behaviour,
the PID file /tmp/brotherscankeyd.pid is created.

For further information, please consult the program's internal help system.
